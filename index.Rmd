# Normalized Cross Correlation
## Winter, 2018

I go through the math and implementation of Normalized Cross Correlation for object detection with a toy example. See 
[https://gjkoplik.github.io/normalized_cross_correlation/](https://gjkoplik.github.io/normalized_cross_correlation/) for more.

# Spectral Clustering
## Fall, 2017

I go through the theory of K-means and Spectral Clustering and include examples of their varying performance. See
[https://gjkoplik.github.io/spectral_clustering/](https://gjkoplik.github.io/spectral_clustering/) for more.

# Interactive Index of Well-Being
## Summer, 2017

I created a county-level Index of Well-Being using data on obesity, poverty, unemployment, and high-school graduation rates. See [https://gjkoplik.github.io/Index-of-Well-Being/](https://gjkoplik.github.io/Index-of-Well-Being/) for more. This interactive map assigns equal weights to each of these four variables, but I allow the user to change the weights on these variables with [this R Shiny app](https://gary-koplik.shinyapps.io/index_of_well_being_shiny/).
